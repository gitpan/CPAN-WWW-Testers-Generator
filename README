NAME
    CPAN::WWW::Testers::Generator - Download and summarize CPAN Testers data

SYNOPSIS
      % cpan_www_testers_generate
      # ... wait patiently for about an hour
      # ... then use testers.db, an SQLite database

DESCRIPTION
    The distribution can download and summarize CPAN Testers data.
    cpan-testers is a group which was initially setup by Graham Barr and
    Chris Nandor. The objective of the group is to test as many of the
    distributions on CPAN as possible, on as many platforms as possible. The
    ultimate goal is to improve the portability of the distributions on
    CPAN, and provide good feedback to the authors.

    CPAN Testers is really a mailing list with a web interface,
    testers.cpan.org. testers.cpan.org was painfully slow. I happened to be
    doing metadata stuff for Module::CPANTS. This is the result.

    This module downloads the cpan-testers newsgroup, and then generates an
    SQLite database containing all the most important information. You can
    then query this database, or use CPAN::WWW::Testers to present it over
    the web.

    A good example query for Acme-Colour would be:

      SELECT version, status, count(*) FROM reports WHERE
      distribution = "Acme-Colour" group by version, status;

    It can over an hour to generate the database file. If you don't want to
    generate the database yourself, I am releasing daily copies of it at
    http://testers.astray.com/testers.db

INTERFACE
  The Constructor
    * new
        Instatiates the object CPAN::WWW::Testers::Generator.

  Methods
    *
    * directory
        Accessor to set/get the directory where the news.db is to be
        created.

    * generate
        Initiates the $obj->download and $obj->insert method calls.

    * download
        Downloads the latest article updates from the NNTP server for the
        cpan-testers newgroup. Articles are then stored in the news.db
        SQLite database.

    * insert
        Reads the local copy of the news.db, and creates the testers.db.

HISTORY
    The CPAN testers was conceived back in May 1998 by Graham Barr and Chris
    Nandor as a way to provide multi-platform testing for modules. Today
    there are over 100,000 tester reports and more than 400 testers giving
    valuable feedback for users and authors alike.

BECOME A TESTER
    Whether you have a common platform or a very unusual one, you can help
    by testing modules you install and submitting reports. There are plenty
    of module authors who could use test reports and helpful feedback on
    their modules and distributions. If you'd like to get involved, please
    take a look at

    Test::Reporter http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-Reporter/,

    CPANPLUS
    http://search.cpan.org/dist/CPANPLUS/lib/CPANPLUS/TesterGuide.pod,

    the cpan-testers mailing list
    http://lists.cpan.org/showlist.cgi?name=cpan-testers

    and start submitting your reports.
