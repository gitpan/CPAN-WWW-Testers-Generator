Things which would be nice to have:

  o A Makefile.PL
  o Module author information
  o There should be a computer-readable version of the website, maybe
    Acme-Colour.yaml or something.
  o The design has to be made prettier.
  o It'd be nice if you could download the sqlite db for everything
  o A CGI script for searching the db
